# MCU Hardware Reference
I used to call myself a geek in a closet, because I kept all my electronic stuff in the closet where no one could see what I was doing in my spare time. Not even the best of friends had a clue. Even my parents did not know what I was working on most of the time. Will there were a few times, like the time when I woke everyone up at 3:00 in the morning with high frequencies coming out from my bedroom. Or the time when they came home and I had their bran new stereo system pulled out and all over the living room, just because I was trying to fix some nose problems. In the middle of high school tings started to come out. Teachers were calling my parent and asking them just what I know. They would normally reply that they do not have any idea. Probably the best thing I ever did was start an advance electronics class with five other students and produce an outline for the instructor of the basic electricity class where I was able to be a teacherâ€™s assistant to help other students. Doing my working days, I had a hole room of microcomputers. Now that I am retired, I back in the closet, will almost. I have armoire full of microcontrollers. More than I ever had with microcomputers. These day the smart students are way smarter, that I ever was and what I know is just a starting point for them.
